Through case studies of green finance instruments and cross-national regulatory regimes, the paper analyzes how uneven access to climate knowledge shapes investment decisions. I argue that correcting informational asymmetries is essential for building political legitimacy and effective markets for decarbonization. The study contributes to debates on climate finance architecture, governance, and justice.
