I develop a mixed-methods framework to anticipate the next generation of climate misinformation narratives. By pairing scenario analysis with empirical studies of past disinformation campaigns, the manuscript highlights the vulnerabilities of public deliberation and policy design. The work outlines strategies for proactive communication and regulatory interventions to protect climate governance from post-truth dynamics.
