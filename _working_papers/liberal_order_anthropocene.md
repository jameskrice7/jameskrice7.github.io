This article reinterprets the liberal order through the lens of complexity theory and ecological constraints. I synthesize heterodox political economy, environmental justice, and institutional analysis to propose governance mechanisms that align liberal norms with the realities of the Anthropocene. The revise-and-resubmit addresses feedback on comparative institutional design and offers new empirical illustrations from climate-vulnerable regions.
