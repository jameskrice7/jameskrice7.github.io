I integrate large-scale social media datasets with firm-level ESG indicators to evaluate whether the spread of climate misinformation depresses environmental, social, and governance performance. Using text mining to identify misinformation narratives and matching them to corporate disclosures, the study traces dynamic relationships between online discourse, capital markets, and sustainability metrics. The findings speak to the risks that disinformation poses for sustainable business practices and regulatory oversight.
