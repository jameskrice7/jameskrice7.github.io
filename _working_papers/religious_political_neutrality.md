The manuscript maps the legal and theological arguments that guide religious leaders when they intervene in public discourse. By tracing judicial decisions, theological commentaries, and comparative case studies, I evaluate how neutrality requirements shape faith-based advocacy on policy questions such as climate action and social welfare. The analysis clarifies the boundaries of religious participation in the public square while advancing a constructive account of political theology for diverse societies.
